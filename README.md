## ✨ Features

### 💬 Chatbot Interface  
Users enter **typed commands** into a terminal-style window, simulating interactions with an AI from a forgotten space station.

### 🌍 3D Globe  
A slowly rotating **3D Earth model** sits behind the chat terminal, reinforcing the lonely, isolated space-vessel feeling.

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech Integration  
The chatbot **speaks its responses aloud**, heightening immersion and creating a sense of a responsive, sentient system.

### ⌨️ Command System  
Specific typed commands return unique responses:

- `help` – display available commands  
- `globe` – highlight the rotating Earth  
- `show secrets` – ???  
- `clear` – reset the terminal view  
- `exit` – simulate a shutdown or end sequence

## 🎨 Aesthetic & Design

The visual and interaction design is heavily inspired by the **Alien franchise's computer systems** and the analog feel of 70s/80s tech:

- 🖤 **Dark theme** with glowing neon green text  
- 🖥️ **Retro terminal** with monospaced fonts and blinking cursors  
- 🪐 Shadowed, dim-lit interface elements for a **claustrophobic, space station vibe**  
- 🧬 Occasional static, scanlines, or screen glitch effects (optional or planned)
