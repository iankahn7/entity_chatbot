entity chatbot
This is a chatbot project that I've been working on, inspired by the eerie and retro aesthetic of the 1970s movie Alien. The design and functionality aim to evoke a sense of mystery and technological isolation, combining command-line style interactions with a sleek, sci-fi inspired interface.

Features
Chatbot Interface: Users can enter text commands into the terminal-style chat window to interact with the chatbot.
3D Globe: A rotating 3D model of Earth is displayed in the background, adding to the futuristic atmosphere.
Text-to-Speech: Text-to-speech functionality is used throughout the site to enhance the immersive experience.
Command System: Commands like help, globe, and show secrets trigger specific responses, creating an interactive, exploration-driven experience.
Aesthetic
The site is designed with a strong Alien movie influence, featuring:

A dark color scheme (black and green) reminiscent of the movie's tone.
A retro, terminal-based interface that channels the feel of classic sci-fi computer systems.
Glowing text and shadow effects to simulate the film's distinctive visual atmosphere.
